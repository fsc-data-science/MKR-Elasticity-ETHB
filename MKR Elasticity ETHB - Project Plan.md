## Question Collection Activity 

Shoutout all the questions you have about ETHB, MKR, and elasticity.

- Is ETH B the most utilized ETH Vault? 
- How often are rates changed in ETH B? 
- Why are rates changed in ETH B?
	- Protect liquidation, bad debt
	- Incentivize use
	- Committee changes
- Are rates fixed, can they be algorithmic?
- What are the non-Maker competitors to ETH B?
- What is Elasticity in this context? 
	- What is the elasticity curve historically?
- What factors seem predictive of changes in ETHB TVL or DAI Minted vs Rate? 
	- MKR Price
	- ETH Price
	- 3rd party integrations: DeFi Saver, Instadapp 
	- ETH GAS

## Synthesize a Hypothesis to Research

What subset of questions, if answered, drive us to an action or understanding of ETHB?

- The market reacts to ETHB's fees relative to other competitor fees?
	- AAVE ETH deposited and USDC & DAI borrows go up. 
- When ETH GAS is more expensive, people make less DAI in ETHB?
- When ETH's price is short-term high (went up fast), ETH B use declines (people go to the cheaper vaults)?

## What is the minimally viable research output?

- Repeatedability over time for the same Vault would be great
- Reproducability of analysis to another Vault
- Major VCs do like deep research
	- Are there specific delegate targets that we want to involve early?

## What steps need to happen by when? 

DATA COLLECTION PHASE 
- ETHB Contract TVL by Block
- ETHB TVL in USD by Block (use on-chain pricing model)
- What are the 3-4 MOST important "knobs" that the commitee has/can wiggled (Cap, Fee rate, Collateralization Rate 130%) -> Raph (filter the parameters page)
- AAVE ETH TVL by Block
- AAVE USDC + DAI borrows by Block
- SPECIFY OUR TIME PERIOD
- ETH Gas at block level (we have this)

HYPOTHESIS/ANALYSIS PHASE

WRITE-UP & METHODOLOGY VERIFICATION PHASE 

MARKET/LAUNCH PHASE

## Known simplifications & assumptions?

- Broad definition of ETHB TVL: # ETH; USD Value using our on-chain pricing formula
- 1 Main Competitor to analyze; AAVE USDC + DAI borrows
- ETH GAS (average gwei per block)
- ETH Price
- Simple Model 

## Dream Outputs

- Application for elasticity curves for any Vault
- Interactive Applications
	- An App for the 5 people committee?
